combine.exe takes all of the zipfiles that are in the folder with it and compiles the data points
needed from the APR's

It then drops them all into one importfile that's configured for use with SF

Each time the combine button is pressed the CSV file will be deleted and rebuilt
This means that all files that you want compiled need to be in the same folder each time you press compile
otherwise those results will not be added
